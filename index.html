          Get ready to test your art knowledge in five exciting rounds, each
          featuring three works of art. Before we dive in, familiarize yourself
          with 15 works and their respective artists. Now, it's time to put your
          memory to the test! In each round, we'll present you with three
          artworks, and your mission is to correctly match a artist with its
          corresponding artwork.
