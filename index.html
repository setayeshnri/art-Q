            Get ready to test your art knowledge in five exciting rounds, each
            featuring three works of art. Before we dive in, familiarize
            yourself with 15 works and their respective artists. Now, it's time
            to put your memory to the test! In each round, we'll present you
            with three artworks, and your mission is to correctly match a artist
            with its corresponding artwork.
